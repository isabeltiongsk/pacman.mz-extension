## About the game
Pacman was created by Japanese video game designer Toru Iwatani. <br>
It was licensed for distribution in the United States by Midway Games and released in October 1980. <br>

### How to play
The player navigates Pac-Man through a maze containing various dots, known as Pac-Dots, and four multi-colored ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde.
The goal of the game is to accumulate points by eating all the Pac-Dots in the maze, completing that 'stage' of the game and starting the next stage and maze of Pac-dots. <br>
Between some stages, one of three intermission animations plays. The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts hit Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game is over.
